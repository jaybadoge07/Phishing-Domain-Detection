# 🛡️ Phishing Domain Detection using Machine Learning

Detect and classify domain names as **legitimate** or **phishing** using supervised machine learning models. This project is built with Python and leverages feature engineering and classification techniques to identify suspicious domains that may be used in phishing attacks.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Phishing websites often use deceptive or slightly altered domain names to trick users. This project trains a machine learning model to distinguish between real and fake domains by analyzing lexical features of domain names.
